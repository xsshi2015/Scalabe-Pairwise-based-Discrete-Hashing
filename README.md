# Scalabe-Pairwise-based-Discrete-Hashing
The codes are the demo of the paper ``A Scalable Optimization Mechanism for Pairwise based Discrete Hashing''.

Please first download gist features of CIFAR10.

Then run the file ``test_cifar10.m''.

``ConstructWeight.m'' constructs a pairwise matrix for single-label dataset;

``ConstructWeightforMultiLabel.m'' constructs a pairwise matrix for multi-label dataset.

It contains four methods, including SDH_P+KSH, GSDH_P+KSH, GSDH_P+BRE, GSDH_P+Hinge
